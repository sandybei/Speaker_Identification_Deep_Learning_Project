# Speaker_Identification_Deep_Learning_Project

Deep Learning Project that uses [VoxCeleb](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/) dataset for the identification of the speaker by their voice.

# Dataset

VoxCeleb is an audio-visual dataset consisting of short clips of human speech, extracted from interview videos uploaded to YouTube. The dataset consists of two versions, VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2. For this project the dataset VoxCeleb1 was selected, that contains over 100,000 utterances for 1,251 celebrities.

A file with full names, nationality and gender labels for all the speakers in the dataset is also provided. From this file the full name will be used for the verification of the speaker.
